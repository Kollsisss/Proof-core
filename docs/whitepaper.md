## 1. Introduction

Proof Blockchain represents a paradigm shift in blockchain technology, offering a unique three-layer architecture designed to address the fundamental challenges of scalability, security, and privacy. This document provides an in-depth exploration of the Proof Blockchain architecture, detailing its components, interactions, and the innovative solutions it brings to the blockchain space.

Our architecture is built on three primary layers:
- Layer 1 (ZZ Protocol): The foundational layer ensuring security and data integrity.
- Layer 2 (XX/YY Protocols): The performance layer, handling high-throughput operations and smart contract execution.
- Layer 3 (ZK-Rollups): The privacy and ultra-fast processing layer, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced scalability and confidentiality.

Each layer is meticulously designed to work in harmony, creating a blockchain ecosystem that is not only technically superior but also user-friendly and adaptable to a wide range of applications.

## 2. Overview of Three-Layer Architecture

The Proof Blockchain's three-layer architecture is designed to separate concerns and optimize for specific aspects of blockchain technology:

```
   +------------------------+
   |    Layer 3: ZK-Rollups |
   |  (Privacy & Speed)     |
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |   Layer 2: XX/YY       |
   |  (Performance)         |
   +------------------------+
              |
              v
   +------------------------+
   |    Layer 1: ZZ         |
   |  (Security & Consensus)|
   +------------------------+
```

This layered approach allows us to:
- Maintain a secure and decentralized base layer
- Scale transaction throughput without compromising security
- Implement privacy features without sacrificing transparency
- Provide flexibility for future upgrades and improvements

Each layer has its specific role and characteristics, which we will explore in detail in the following sections.

## 3. Layer 1 (ZZ Protocol): The Foundation

Layer 1, implemented through the ZZ Protocol, forms the bedrock of the Proof Blockchain. It is responsible for maintaining the overall security, consensus, and integrity of the entire network.

### Key Components:

1. **Blockchain Structure**
   - Block Time: Exactly 10 minutes
   - Block Size: Dynamic, with a maximum size of 10MB
   - Block Header: Contains previous block hash, timestamp, Merkle root of transactions, and validator signature

2. **Consensus Mechanism**
   - Type: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
   - Validator Set: 101 active validators
   - Validator Selection: Based on stake amount and community reputation

3. **Native Token: PROOF**
   - Total Supply: 35,035,035 PROOF
   - Use: Transaction fees, staking, and governance

4. **State Management**
   - World State Trie: Stores the current state of all accounts and contracts
   - Transaction Trie: Stores all transactions within a block
   - Receipt Trie: Stores the outcomes of all transactions

5. **Network Protocol**
   - P2P Network: LibP2P-based peer discovery and communication
   - Gossip Protocol: For efficient block and transaction propagation

6. **Cryptographic Primitives**
   - Digital Signatures: ED25519 for transaction signing
   - Hash Function: SHA-3 for block and transaction hashing

7. **Data Availability**
   - Full nodes store the entire blockchain history
   - Light clients can verify block headers and specific transactions

8. **Access Logging**
   - Records all data access attempts on-chain using Proof Keys
   - Maintains a transparent, immutable log of data access

### Detailed Process Flow:

1. **Block Production**
   a. The selected validator for the current 10-minute slot prepares a new block
   b. Transactions are collected from the mempool and validated
   c. The block is assembled, including the Merkle root of transactions and the current state root
   d. The validator signs the block with their private key

2. **Block Propagation and Validation**
   a. The new block is broadcast to the network
   b. Other validators receive the block and verify:
      - Block structure and size
      - Transaction validity
      - Merkle roots
      - Producer's signature
   c. If valid, validators add the block to their local chain and update their state

3. **Finality**
   a. A block is considered final when it has been confirmed by 2/3 + 1 of the active validator set
   b. Finality is typically achieved within 30 seconds after block production

4. **State Updates**
   a. After each block, the world state trie is updated to reflect new account balances and contract states
   b. The transaction and receipt tries are updated with new data

5. **Access Logging**
   a. When a data access request is made, it's first validated against the requester's permissions
   b. If valid, a log entry is created containing:
      - Requester's Proof Key
      - Timestamp
      - Resource identifier (e.g., contract address)
   c. This log entry is included in the next block, creating an immutable record of the access attempt

Example of an Access Log Entry:
```json
{
  "proofKey": "0x7f9fade1c0d57a7af66ab4ead79fade1c0d57a7af66ab4ead7c2c2eb7b11a91385",
  "timestamp": 1615480320,
  "resourceId": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e",
  "accessType": "read"
}
```

Layer 1 serves as the trust anchor for the entire system. Its robust consensus mechanism and transparent logging system ensure that all operations across the network can be verified and audited, providing a solid foundation for the higher layers to build upon.

## 4. Layer 2 (XX/YY Protocols): Performance and Scalability

Layer 2 is the powerhouse of the Proof Blockchain, designed to handle high-throughput operations and complex computations. It is split into two main protocols: XX Protocol for general operations and smart contract execution, and YY Protocol for cross-chain interactions and altcoin integration.

### XX Protocol

The XX Protocol is responsible for processing the majority of transactions and executing smart contracts. It achieves high performance through advanced sharding techniques and optimized execution environments.

#### Key Components:

1. **Sharding**
   - Number of Shards: Dynamic, starting with 16 and scalable up to 256
   - Shard Assignment: Based on account addresses (last 8 bits)
   - Cross-Shard Transactions: Handled through an atomic commit protocol

2. **Execution Environment**
   - Virtual Machine: WebAssembly (Wasm)-based for efficient contract execution
   - State Channels: For off-chain computations with on-chain settlements

3. **Smart Contract Support**
   - Languages: Rust, AssemblyScript
   - Compiler: Specialized compiler that optimizes for gas efficiency and security

4. **Transaction Processing**
   - Throughput: Up to 100,000 TPS across all shards
   - Latency: Average confirmation time of 1-2 seconds

#### Process Flow:

1. **Transaction Submission**
   a. User submits a transaction to the network
   b. Transaction is routed to the appropriate shard based on the sender's address

2. **Shard Processing**
   a. Validators in the shard validate and execute the transaction
   b. State changes are recorded in the shard's state trie

3. **Cross-Shard Communication**
   a. For transactions involving multiple shards, an atomic commit protocol is used
   b. Involved shards prepare the transaction and vote on its validity
   c. If all shards agree, the transaction is committed; otherwise, it's rolled back

4. **Block Production**
   a. Each shard produces micro-blocks every 0.5 seconds
   b. Micro-blocks are aggregated into a macro-block every 10 seconds

5. **State Sync with Layer 1**
   a. Every 10 minutes, coinciding with Layer 1's block time, a summary of Layer 2 state is committed to Layer 1
   b. This summary includes Merkle roots of each shard's state and a list of cross-shard transaction results

Example of a Cross-Shard Transaction:
```json
{
  "txHash": "0x3a1b2c...",
  "from": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e", // Shard 14
  "to": "0x8f1d3A2347c63f7Ab74e9315455D2b2E75a2d448",   // Shard 8
  "value": "10.5 PROOF",
  "shards": [14, 8],
  "status": "committed"
}
```

### YY Protocol

The YY Protocol extends the capabilities of Proof Blockchain to interact with other blockchain networks and integrate various cryptocurrencies.

#### Key Components:

1. **Bridge Contracts**
   - Ethereum Bridge: For interoperability with Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens
   - Bitcoin Bridge: For Bitcoin wrapping and transactions

2. **Liquidity Pools**
   - Automated Market Maker (AMM) for efficient token swaps
   - Yield farming and liquidity mining mechanisms

3. **Wrapped Assets**
   - Representation of external assets (e.g., WBTC, WETH) on Proof Blockchain

4. **Cross-Chain Validation**
   - Light clients of connected blockchains for transaction verification
   - Threshold signature schemes for secure multi-party computation

#### Process Flow:

1. **Asset Bridging**
   a. User locks assets in the origin chain's bridge contract
   b. YY Protocol validators confirm the lock on the origin chain
   c. Equivalent wrapped assets are minted on Proof Blockchain

2. **Cross-Chain Transactions**
   a. User initiates a transaction involving a bridged asset
   b. YY Protocol processes the transaction on Proof Blockchain
   c. Corresponding action is taken on the origin chain (e.g., release of locked funds)

3. **Liquidity Provision**
   a. Users can provide liquidity to AMM pools
   b. Liquidity providers earn fees and yield farming rewards

Example of a Bridging Transaction:
```json
{
  "originChain": "Ethereum",
  "originTxHash": "0x1a2b3c...",
  "asset": "ETH",
  "amount": "5.0",
  "proofAddress": "0x9d8A62f656a8d1615C1294fd71e9CFb3E4855A4F",
  "wrappedAsset": "WETH",
  "bridgeContract": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
}
```

Layer 2, with its XX and YY Protocols, forms the high-performance backbone of Proof Blockchain. It enables complex operations, smart contract execution, and cross-chain interactions while maintaining the security guarantees provided by Layer 1.

## 5. Layer 3 (ZK-Rollups): Ultra-Fast Processing and Privacy

Layer 3 of the Proof Blockchain leverages ZK-Rollups technology to provide unparalleled transaction speed and enhanced privacy. This layer is designed to handle a massive number of transactions off-chain while still benefiting from the security of the main chain.

### Key Components:

1. **ZK-Rollup Structure**
   - Operator: Responsible for batching transactions and generating proofs
   - Verifier Contract: Deployed on Layer 1, verifies validity proofs
   - State Tree: Merkle tree representing the current state of all accounts in the rollup

2. **Cryptographic Primitives**
   - Zero-Knowledge Proof System: zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
   - Hash Function: Poseidon, optimized for zk-SNARKs

3. **Transaction Types**
   - Deposit: Move assets from Layer 1 to Layer 3
   - Transfer: Move assets between accounts within Layer 3
   - Withdraw: Move assets from Layer 3 back to Layer 1

4. **Privacy Features**
   - Transaction Amount Privacy: Amounts are hidden using Pedersen commitments
   - Address Privacy: Stealth addresses for enhanced anonymity

### Detailed Process Flow:

1. **Transaction Submission**
   a. User creates a transaction and sends it to the rollup operator
   b. Transaction is encrypted with the user's public key

2. **Batch Creation**
   a. Operator collects multiple transactions into a batch
   b. Applies the transactions to the current state tree
   c. Generates a new state root

3. **Proof Generation**
   a. Operator creates a zk-SNARK proof that:
      - All transactions in the batch are valid
      - The state transition from the old root to the new root is correct
   b. Proof generation is computationally intensive but fast to verify

4. **Submission to Layer 1**
   a. Operator submits to Layer 1:
      - New state root
      - zk-SNARK proof
      - Encrypted transaction data

5. **Verification**
   a. Layer 1 verifier contract checks the zk-SNARK proof
   b. If valid, the new state root is accepted

6. **Finalization**
   a. Once accepted on Layer 1, all transactions in the batch are considered final
   b. Users can now use their updated balances for further transactions

7. **Withdrawals**
   a. User initiates a withdrawal by sending a transaction to the operator
   b. Operator includes the withdrawal in a batch and provides a Merkle proof
   c. User can then claim their funds on Layer 1 using this proof

Example of a ZK-Rollup Batch:
```json
{
  "batchId": 1234,
  "oldStateRoot": "0x1a2b3c...",
  "newStateRoot": "0x4d5e6f...",
  "proof": "0x9a8b7c...",
  "transactionsHash": "0x7a8b9c...",
  "encryptedTransactions": "0x1d2e3f..."
}
```

### Privacy Mechanisms:

1. **Transaction Amount Privacy**
   - Uses Pedersen commitments to hide transaction amounts
   - Example: Instead of storing "A sends 10 tokens to B", we store "A sends C to B" where C is a commitment to 10

2. **Address Privacy**
   - Implements stealth addresses for each transaction
   - Users generate a new address for each incoming transaction
   - Only the recipient can link the stealth address to their actual address

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
   - Allows verification of transactions without revealing their contents
   - Proves that a transaction is valid (sender has sufficient balance, etc.) without disclosing actual amounts or addresses

Example of a Private Transaction:
```json
{
  "from": "stealth_address_1",
  "to": "stealth_address_2",
  "amountCommitment": "0x2a3b4c...",
  "nullifier": "0x5e6f7g...",
  "proof": "0x8h9i0j..."
}
```

Layer 3's ZK-Rollups provide a powerful combination of scalability and privacy. By processing thousands of transactions off-chain and submitting only compact proofs to Layer 1, it dramatically increases the overall throughput of the system while maintaining strong security guarantees.

## 6. Cross-Layer Interactions

The seamless interaction between the three layers is crucial for the overall functionality and efficiency of Proof Blockchain. Here's how the layers interact:

### Layer 3 to Layer 2

1. **Batch Submissions**
   - ZK-Rollup operators on Layer 3 submit transaction batches to Layer 2
   - Layer 2 (XX Protocol) verifies the zk-SNARK proofs

2. **State Updates**
   - Layer 2 updates its state based on the verified Layer 3 batches
   - This includes updating account balances and contract states

### Layer 2 to Layer 1

1. **State Commitments**
   - Every 10 minutes, Layer 2 submits a state commitment to Layer 1
   - This commitment includes:
     * Merkle roots of each shard's state
     * Summary of cross-shard transactions
     * Aggregate of Layer 3 state updates

2. **Validator Rotation**
   - Layer 1 manages the validator set for Layer 2
   - Changes in staking on Layer 1 affect validator selection on Layer 2

### Layer 1 to Layer 2

1. **Finality Confirmation**
   - Layer 1 provides final confirmation of state updates to Layer 2
   - This allows Layer 2 to safely prune old data

2. **Governance Decisions**
   - Protocol upgrades and major decisions made on Layer 1 are propagated to Layer 2

### Direct Layer 3 to Layer 1 Interactions

1. **Deposits and Withdrawals**
   - Users can deposit funds directly from Layer 1 to Layer 3
   - Withdrawals from Layer 3 to Layer 1 require a waiting period for security

2. **Emergency Exits**
   - In case of Layer 2 failures, users can exit directly from Layer 3 to Layer 1

Example of a Cross-Layer Transaction Flow:
```
User initiates transaction on Layer 3
  │
  ▼
Layer 3 processes transaction in a batch
  │
  ▼
Layer 3 submits batch to Layer 2
  │
  ▼
Layer 2 verifies and incorporates Layer 3 batch
  │
  ▼
Layer 2 includes state update in its commitment to Layer 1
  │
  ▼
Layer 1 finalizes the state update
  │
  ▼
Confirmation propagated back to Layer 2 and Layer 3
```

## 7. Data Management and Privacy

Proof Blockchain implements a sophisticated data management system that balances transparency with privacy:

### Off-Chain Encrypted Data Storage

1. **Encryption**
   - All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption
   - Data is stored off-chain in a distributed storage system

2. **Access Control**
   - Data access is managed through smart contracts
   - Temporary access keys are issued with a 1-hour timeout

3. **Key Management**
   - Users' encryption keys are managed through a secure key management system
   - Keys are never stored in plain text, only salted hashes are kept

### On-Chain Access Logging

1. **Logging Mechanism**
   - Every data access attempt is logged on-chain
   - Logs include the accessor's Proof Key, timestamp, and resource identifier

2. **Transparency**
   - Access logs are public and can be audited by anyone
   - This creates accountability without compromising data privacy

Example of an Access Log Entry:
```json
{
  "accessorProofKey": "0x1a2b3c...",
  "timestamp": 1634567890,
  "resourceId": "0x4d5e6f...",
  "accessType": "read"
}
```

### Data Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Data is encrypted client-side before being sent to storage
   - A reference to the data location is stored in the relevant smart contract

2. **Storage**
   - Encrypted data is stored in a distributed file system (e.g., IPFS)
   - The storage system is decentralized to prevent single points of failure

3. **Access**
   - When data access is requested, the smart contract issues a temporary access key
   - The access attempt is immediately logged on-chain
   - The user can decrypt and access the data for the duration of the key's validity

4. **Deletion**
   - Data can be marked for deletion in the smart contract
   - The actual data removal from the distributed storage is handled by a garbage collection process

### Privacy vs. Transparency Trade-offs

- Transaction amounts and participant identities on Layer 3 are private
- The fact that a transaction occurred is public, maintaining auditability
- Smart contract logic on Layer 2 is public, but the data they operate on can be private
- Layer 1 provides a public, verifiable history of state transitions without revealing the details

This system ensures that Proof Blockchain can offer strong privacy guarantees while still maintaining the transparency and auditability that are crucial for a public blockchain.

## 8. Security Measures

Security is paramount in Proof Blockchain's design. Multiple layers of security measures are implemented across all three layers:

### Cryptographic Security

1. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
   - Implementation: Lattice-based cryptographic schemes
   - Application: Used in all signature schemes and encryption methods

2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
   - Type: zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
   - Purpose: Validating transactions without disclosing details

### Layer-Specific Security

1. **Layer 1 (ZZ Protocol) Security**
   - Consensus Security: Delegated Proof of Stake with slashing conditions
   - Validator Rotation: Regular rotation of validator set to prevent centralization
   - Long-Range Attack Prevention: Weak subjectivity checkpoints

2. **Layer 2 (XX/YY Protocols) Security**
   - Fraud Proofs: Allows any party to challenge invalid state transitions
   - Data Availability Checks: Ensures all data needed to reconstruct the state is available
   - Cross-Shard Atomicity: Two-phase commit protocol for cross-shard transactions

3. **Layer 3 (ZK-Rollups) Security**
   - Validity Proofs: zk-SNARKs ensure that only valid state transitions are accepted
   - Exit Games: Allows users to safely withdraw funds even if operators are malicious

### Network Security

1. **DDoS Protection**
   - Implementation: Traffic filtering and rate limiting at the network edge
   - Sybil Attack Prevention: Proof of Stake makes it economically unfeasible to spawn many nodes

2. **Secure Communication**
   - All node-to-node communication is encrypted using TLS 1.3
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy ensures past communications remain secure

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Formal Verification**
   - Critical smart contracts are formally verified using tools like Coq or Isabelle
   - This mathematically proves the correctness of the contract's logic

2. **Automated Auditing**
   - Continuous automated audits using tools like Mythril and Slither
   - Regular manual audits by third-party security firms

3. **Upgrade Mechanisms**
   - Proxy patterns allow for upgrading contracts while preserving state
   - Time-locked upgrades with community governance for critical contracts

### Operational Security

1. **Multi-Signature Wallets**
   - All critical operations require multiple signatures
   - Hardware security modules (HSMs) are used for key storage

2. **Bug Bounty Program**
   - Ongoing bug bounty program with significant rewards for critical vulnerabilities

Example of a Security Incident Response Flow:
```
Incident Detected
  │
  ▼
Immediate Triage
  │
  ▼
Activate Incident Response Team
  │
  ▼
Assess Impact and Contain
  │
  ▼
Investigate Root Cause
  │
  ▼
Develop and Apply Fix
  │
  ▼
Verify Fix and Restore Systems
  │
  ▼
Post-Incident Review and Report
```

These comprehensive security measures ensure that Proof Blockchain remains resilient against a wide range of potential threats, from cryptographic attacks to operational vulnerabilities.

## 9. Consensus Mechanism

Proof Blockchain employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that leverages the strengths of different approaches across its layers:

### Layer 1: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

1. **Validator Set**
   - Size: 101 active validators
   - Selection: Based on stake amount and community reputation

2. **Staking**
   - Minimum Stake: 10,000 PROOF tokens
   - Staking Period: 21 days minimum with a 7-day unbonding period

3. **Block Production**
   - Round Robin: Each validator takes turns producing blocks
   - Block Time: 10 minutes

4. **Finality**
   - Type: Probabilistic, then Absolute
   - Time to Finality: 5 blocks (50 minutes) for practical finality, 50 blocks (500 minutes) for absolute finality

5. **Slashing Conditions**
   - Double Signing: 5% of staked amount
   - Downtime: 1% of staked amount per hour of inactivity

### Layer 2: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)

1. **Consensus Groups**
   - Each shard has its own consensus group
   - Group Size: 21 validators per shard

2. **Block Production**
   - Micro-blocks: Produced every 0.5 seconds
   - Macro-blocks: Aggregation of micro-blocks every 10 seconds

3. **Finality**
   - Instant finality within each shard
   - Cross-shard finality achieved through atomic commit protocol

4. **Validator Rotation**
   - Validators are rotated between shards every 24 hours
   - Rotation is pseudo-random based on Layer 1 block hash

### Layer 3: ZK-Rollup Validity Proofs

1. **Operator Selection**
   - Multiple operators can submit batches
   - Selection based on gas price bid and historical performance

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Operators collect transactions and create batches
   - zk-SNARK proofs are generated for each batch

3. **Verification**
   - Proofs are verified on Layer 2
   - Successful verification results in state update

4. **Finality**
   - Achieved once the batch is included and verified on Layer 2
   - Further secured when Layer 2 state is committed to Layer 1

Example of Consensus Flow:
```
Layer 3:
Transaction Batch Created → zk-SNARK Proof Generated
              │
              ▼
Layer 2:
Proof Verified → State Updated → Cross-Shard Consensus (if needed)
              │
              ▼
Layer 1:
State Commitment Included → Finality Achieved after 50 blocks
```

This hybrid approach allows Proof Blockchain to achieve high throughput and low latency on Layer 2 and Layer 3, while maintaining strong security guarantees through the DPoS consensus on Layer 1.

use proof_std::*;

#[proof_contract]
pub struct TokenContract {
    total_supply: u64,
    balances: Map<Address, u64>,
}

#[proof_methods]
impl TokenContract {
    pub fn new(initial_supply: u64) -> Self {
        let mut contract = Self {
            total_supply: initial_supply,
            balances: Map::new(),
        };
        let deployer = env::current_account();
        contract.balances.insert(deployer, initial_supply);
        contract
    }

    pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, amount: u64) -> bool {
        let from = env::current_account();
        let from_balance = self.balances.get(&from).unwrap_or(0);
        if from_balance < amount {
            return false;
        }
        let to_balance = self.balances.get(&to).unwrap_or(0);
        self.balances.insert(from, from_balance - amount);
        self.balances.insert(to, to_balance + amount);
        true
    }

    pub fn balance_of(&self, account: Address) -> u64 {
        self.balances.get(&account).unwrap_or(0)
    }
}

This smart contract system provides developers with powerful tools to create complex decentralized applications while maintaining security and efficiency.

## 11. Network Topology

Proof Blockchain's network topology is designed to ensure high performance, security,
and decentralization. It is structured to support the three-layer architecture efficiently:

### Node Types

1. **Full Nodes**
   - Store the complete blockchain history
   - Participate in transaction and block validation
   - Run on all three layers (ZZ, XX/YY, and ZK-Rollups)

2. **Light Nodes**
   - Store only block headers and a subset of transactions
   - Useful for resource-constrained devices
   - Can verify transactions using Merkle proofs

3. **Validator Nodes**
   - Special full nodes that participate in block production
   - Require staking of PROOF tokens
   - Run advanced hardware for efficient block production and validation

4. **ZK-Rollup Operators**
   - Specialized nodes that aggregate Layer 3 transactions
   - Generate zero-knowledge proofs for transaction batches

### Network Structure

1. **Peer Discovery**
   - Uses a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) for peer discovery
   - Kademlia-based protocol for efficient routing

2. **Connectivity**
   - Nodes maintain connections to multiple peers
   - Minimum Connections: 8
   - Maximum Connections: 125

3. **Sharding**
   - Network is divided into shards on Layer 2
   - Each shard has its own sub-network of nodes

4. **Cross-Shard Communication**
   - Dedicated nodes serve as bridges between shards
   - Use a gossip protocol for efficient message propagation

### Data Flow

1. **Transaction Propagation**
   - Uses a gossip protocol with eager push and lazy pull
   - Bloom filters used to prevent redundant transmissions

2. **Block Propagation**
   - Compact block relay to reduce bandwidth usage
   - Critical for maintaining network synchronization

3. **State Sync**
   - Fast sync mechanism for new nodes joining the network
   - Snapshot-based sync for quick onboarding

### Security Measures

1. **Eclipse Attack Prevention**
   - IP address diversity requirements
   - Regular rotation of network connections

2. **Sybil Attack Mitigation**
   - Proof of Stake makes it economically unfeasible to create many nodes
   - Reputation system for peer scoring

3. **DDoS Protection**
   - Rate limiting at the network edge
   - Blacklisting of malicious IPs

### 1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

**Use Case**: High-frequency trading and liquidity provision

**Example**: Automated Market Maker (AMM) Protocol

```rust
#[proof_contract]
pub struct AMM {
    token_a_reserve: u128,
    token_b_reserve: u128,
    total_shares: u128,
    shares: Map<Address, u128>,
}

#[proof_methods]
impl AMM {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            token_a_reserve: 0,
            token_b_reserve: 0,
            total_shares: 0,
            shares: Map::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn add_liquidity(&mut self, token_a_amount: u128, token_b_amount: u128) -> u128 {
        let shares_minted = if self.total_shares == 0 {
            (token_a_amount * token_b_amount).sqrt()
        } else {
            min(
                token_a_amount * self.total_shares / self.token_a_reserve,
                token_b_amount * self.total_shares / self.token_b_reserve,
            )
        };

        let sender = env::current_account();
        self.shares.insert(sender, self.shares.get(&sender).unwrap_or(0) + shares_minted);
        self.total_shares += shares_minted;
        self.token_a_reserve += token_a_amount;
        self.token_b_reserve += token_b_amount;

        shares_minted
    }

    pub fn swap(&mut self, token_in: u128, is_token_a: bool) -> u128 {
        let (in_reserve, out_reserve) = if is_token_a {
            (self.token_a_reserve, self.token_b_reserve)
        } else {
            (self.token_b_reserve, self.token_a_reserve)
        };

        let token_out = (token_in * out_reserve) / (in_reserve + token_in);

        if is_token_a {
            self.token_a_reserve += token_in;
            self.token_b_reserve -= token_out;
        } else {
            self.token_b_reserve += token_in;
            self.token_a_reserve -= token_out;
        }

        token_out
    }
}
```

This AMM implementation leverages Proof Blockchain's high throughput to enable efficient and low-cost trading, while the security of Layer 1 ensures the safety of funds.

### 2. Supply Chain Management

}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ProductInfo {
    id: u128,
    name: String,
    manufacturer: Address,
    current_owner: Address,
    status: ProductStatus,
    history: Vec<OwnershipChange>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ProductStatus {
    Manufactured,
    InTransit,
    Delivered,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OwnershipChange {
    from: Address,
    to: Address,
    timestamp: u64,
}

#[proof_methods]
impl SupplyChain {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            products: Map::new(),
            product_count: 0,
        }
    }

    pub fn create_product(&mut self, name: String) -> u128 {
        let id = self.product_count + 1;
        let manufacturer = env::current_account();

        let product = ProductInfo {
            id,
            name,
            manufacturer: manufacturer.clone(),
            current_owner: manufacturer,
            status: ProductStatus::Manufactured,
            history: vec![],
        };

        self.products.insert(id, product);
        self.product_count += 1;

        id
    }

    pub fn transfer_ownership(&mut self, product_id: u128, new_owner: Address) {
        let mut product = self.products.get(&product_id).expect("Product not found");
        let current_owner = env::current_account();
        assert_eq!(product.current_owner, current_owner, "Not the current owner");

        let change = OwnershipChange {
            from: current_owner,
            to: new_owner.clone(),
            timestamp: env::block_timestamp(),
        };

        product.history.push(change);
        product.current_owner = new_owner;
        product.status = ProductStatus::InTransit;

        self.products.insert(product_id, product);
    }

    pub fn get_product_info(&self, product_id: u128) -> Option<ProductInfo> {
        self.products.get(&product_id)
    }
}
```

### 3. Decentralized Identity

**Use Case**: Self-sovereign identity management

**Example**: Decentralized Identity Contract

```rust
#[proof_contract]
pub struct DecentralizedIdentity {
    identities: Map<Address, Identity>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Identity {
    did: String,
    public_key: String,
    attributes: Map<String, String>,
    verifications: Vec<Verification>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Verification {
    attribute: String,
    verifier: Address,
    signature: String,
    timestamp: u64,
}

#[proof_methods]
impl DecentralizedIdentity {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            identities: Map::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn create_identity(&mut self, public_key: String) {
        let sender = env::current_account();
        let did = format!("did:proof:{}", sender);

        let identity = Identity {
            did,
            public_key,
            attributes: Map::new(),
            verifications: vec![],
        };

        self.identities.insert(sender, identity);
    }

    pub fn add_attribute(&mut self, key: String, value: String) {
        let sender = env::current_account();
        let mut identity = self.identities.get(&sender).expect("Identity not found");
        identity.attributes.insert(key, value);
        self.identities.insert(sender, identity);
    }

    pub fn verify_attribute(&mut self, subject: Address, attribute: String, signature: String) {
        let verifier = env::current_account();
        let mut identity = self.identities.get(&subject).expect("Identity not found");

        let verification = Verification {
            attribute,
            verifier,
            signature,
            timestamp: env::block_timestamp(),
        };

        identity.verifications.push(verification);
        self.identities.insert(subject, identity);
    }

    pub fn get_identity(&self, subject: Address) -> Option<Identity> {

    pub fn new(initial_supply: u128) -> Self {
        let mut dao = Self {
            proposals: Map::new(),
            proposal_count: 0,
            token_balance: Map::new(),
            total_supply: initial_supply,
        };
        let sender = env::current_account();
        dao.token_balance.insert(sender, initial_supply);
        dao
    }

    pub fn create_proposal(&mut self, description: String, duration: u64) -> u128 {
        let id = self.proposal_count + 1;
        let deadline = env::block_timestamp() + duration;

        let proposal = Proposal {
            id,
            description,
            votes_for: 0,
            votes_against: 0,
            deadline,
            executed: false,
        };

        self.proposals.insert(id, proposal);
        self.proposal_count += 1;

        id
    }

        let balance = self.token_balance.get(&sender).expect("No voting power");
        let mut proposal = self.proposals.get(&proposal_id).expect("Proposal not found");

        assert!(env::block_timestamp() < proposal.deadline, "Voting period has ended");

        if vote {
            proposal.votes_for += balance;
        } else {
            proposal.votes_against += balance;
        }

        self.proposals.insert(proposal_id, proposal);
    }

    pub fn execute_proposal(&mut self, proposal_id: u128) {
        let mut proposal = self.proposals.
        get(&proposal_id).expect("Proposal not found");

        assert!(env::block_timestamp() >= proposal.deadline, "Voting period not ended");
        assert!(!proposal.executed, "Proposal already executed");

        if proposal.votes_for > proposal.votes_against {
            // Execute the proposal
            // This is where you would implement the actual execution logic
            proposal.executed = true;
            self.proposals.insert(proposal_id, proposal);
        }
    }

    pub fn get_proposal(&self, proposal_id: u128) -> Option<Proposal> {
        self.proposals.get(&proposal_id)
    }

    pub fn transfer(&mut self, to: Address, amount: u128) {
        let sender = env::current_account();
        let sender_balance = self.token_balance.get(&sender).expect("No balance");
        assert!(sender_balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        let to_balance = self.token_balance.get(&to).unwrap_or(0);

        self.token_balance.insert(sender, sender_balance - amount);
        self.token_balance.insert(to, to_balance + amount);

        // Ensure the buyer has sent enough PROOF tokens
        assert!(env::attached_deposit() >= listing.price, "Insufficient payment");

        let mut token = self.tokens.get(&token_id).expect("Token not found");

        // Transfer ownership
        token.owner = buyer.clone();

        // Pay the seller
        let royalty = listing.price / 10; // 10% royalty
        env::transfer(token.creator, royalty);
        env::transfer(listing.seller, listing.price - royalty);

        // Update state
        self.tokens.insert(token_id, token);
        self.listings.remove(&token_id);
    }
